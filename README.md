open game dev for everyone !


⭐ PROJECT R — Open Systems Library

Making game development simple, shared, and free.

Project R is a growing collection of plug-and-play systems (Unity & any engine) built for beginners, solo devs, and anyone who wants to learn faster.
Everything here is open, modular, and easy to use.



📦 Using a System

Open a system folder

Copy the script(s)

Follow the short “How To Use” section

Done — plug & play

🙏 Note

I’m building this alone right now and aiming for 100 systems.
Every script shared helps someone else learn and build faster.

Thank you for being part of the revolution. ❤️
